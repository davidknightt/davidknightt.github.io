              <p><strong>1. INTRODUCTION.</strong>  Thank you for choosing HelloGbye to plan your travel.  </p>

              <p>HelloGbye offers travel management related services, products, technologies, features, content and functions on a fully digital platform (collectively, the <strong>Services</strong> and each individually, a <strong>HelloGbye Service</strong>) by way of <strong><a href="http://www.hellogbye.com">www.hellogbye.com</a></strong>, and any other websites controlled by HelloGbye (collectively, the <strong>Site</strong>), and by way of a download of the HelloGbye application which is available through the Site, or the Apple, Inc. App Store (the <strong>App</strong>).  </p>

              <p>The term "<strong>you</strong>" refers to any person or user that accesses the Services using the Site or the App.  In the case of a company,  organization or entity establishing an account (a <strong>Small Business</strong>, and such account a <strong>Small Business Account), “you”</strong> includes the administrator and any person identified by the Small Business from time to time who accesses or uses the Services, the Site or the App. The terms “you” and “your” as used in these Terms apply to both you and the Small Business, as applicable. </p>

              <p>The Services are offered in various jurisdictions by the HelloGbye entity noted at the bottom of these Terms, and together with their respective parent companies, affiliates or related parties are collectively referred to as <strong>HelloGbye, we, our <em>* or *</em>us</strong>.

              <p>THESE TERMS CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, REMEDIES AND OBLIGATIONS. THESE TERMS INCLUDE VARIOUS LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS, INFORMATION ABOUT AUTOMATIC RENEWALS AND FEES, INFORMATION ABOUT PRIVACY, A CLASS ACTION WAIVER, INFORMATION ABOUT FUTURE CHANGES TO TERMS, A CLAUSE THAT GOVERNS THE JURISDICTION AND VENUE OF DISPUTES, AND OBLIGATIONS TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS.</p>

              <p>d. you will only access and/or use the Services, the Site, and/or the App to make legitimate travel management searches for yourself or Companions (as defined below) as permitted by these Terms; </p>

              <p>e. you will not: (i) publish, publically perform or display, or communicate to the public or otherwise distribute to any third party, any Content (as defined below); (ii) market, sell, re-sell the Services, the Site, the App or any Content;  (iii) make derivative uses of the Services, the Site, the App or the Content; or (iv) otherwise breach the terms of any Third Party Provider applicable to you;</p>

              <p>f. all information supplied by you (including without limitation home or business address (which must match the current address on file with your credit card provider), contact email address, birth date, and travel documentation information) is true, accurate, correct, current and complete, and you agree to promptly update your account or Small Business Account profile information in order to keep it true, accurate, correct and current at all times; </p>

              <p>g. you will safeguard your account or Small Business Account information, user name and password (collectively, <strong>ID</strong>) which allows you to access and/or use the Services, the Site and the App; </p>

              <p>h. HelloGbye is not responsible to maintain your search or travel history indefinitely;</p>

              <p>i. you are not listed on any government list of prohibited or restricted parties; and</p>

              <p>j. you are a resident in a country, state or province where the Services are available.</p>

              <p><em>*2 MODIFICATION OF TERMS. *</em> We may make changes to the Terms including changes to Access Fees (defined below) and Membership Fees (defined below), and if we do so, we will post the revised Terms on the Site and App, or we will otherwise communicate the changes to you.  Please read all notices from HelloGbye carefully.  The revised version of the Terms will be effective at the time that we post it.  Your continued use of the Services, the Site and/or the App will be deemed to constitute your conclusive acceptance of the revised Terms. EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN THE BINDING ARBITRATION PROVISION BELOW, IF THE REVISED TERMS ARE NOT ACCEPTABLE TO YOU, YOUR ONLY RECOURSE IS TO STOP USING THE SERVICES, THE SITE AND THE APP.</p>

              <p><strong>3. OUR SERVICES, REGISTRATION &amp; PAID ANNUAL SUBSCRIPTIONS.</strong> HelloGbye provides access to the Services online through the Site or the App for a fee (<strong>Access Fee</strong>). You agree that all Access Fees charged and paid by you are always non-refundable.  For an additional cost, you can make changes to an itinerary which you booked using the Services by contacting our customer service representatives at the number noted below.</p>

              <p>To use the Services, each user must register using the Site or the App to create an account or Small Business Account.  Certain features may not be available to all users. We will explain which services are available to you depending on your location when you register.  You may register through the Site or the App as: </p>

              <p>a. basic "pay as you go" user (<strong>Basic User</strong>) whereby you must pay Access Fees to use certain Services; </p>

              <p>b. a frequent traveler member (<strong>Member</strong>) with an annual membership subscription (<strong>Membership</strong>) whereby you must pay an annual membership fee (<strong>Membership Fee</strong>) continuously and monthly in advance  to receive privileges provided from time to time as posted on the Site and the App, such as preferred hotel rates, and "cash-back" or other incentive programs for qualifying Members; or</p>

              <p>c. an administrator for a <strong>Small Business</strong> and associated <strong>Small Business Account</strong>.  If you open a Small Business Account you unconditionally represent and warrant that you are authorized to grant all permissions and licenses provided in the Terms and that you are authorized to bind the Small Business to the Terms.  A Small Business Account permits individuals within a single Small Business to register as individual Members for a Membership Fee payable by the Small Business.  Terms pertaining to Small Businesses may vary from time to time.</p>

              <p>You may choose to invite individuals, who may or may not have registered with HelloGbye, to "join" your itinerary (<strong>Companions</strong>).  Companions must be 18 years of age.  You represent, warrant, covenant and confirm that all information supplied by you on behalf of Companions is true, accurate, current and complete.  Companions may choose to register an account with HelloGbye, thereby permitting certain costs of itineraries to be shared (to the extent permitted by travel industry legislation and regulation) at check-out.</p>

              <p>Any changes to privileges, features, Access Fees and Membership Fees will be posted to the Site and the App in advance of such change. Your continued use of the Services, the Site or the App after the change to privileges, features, Access Fees or Membership Fees goes into effect constitutes your agreement to such changes.  If as a Member you cancel your Membership, or if your Membership is interrupted (for example, you do not make payment of your monthly membership fee) you will forfeit your eligibility to receive proceeds under the cash-back or other incentive programs, and other privileges associated with being a Member.  Access Fees and Membership Fees can be paid by major credit cards then accepted by HelloGbye.</p>

              <p>When you register for a Membership you consent to get access to the Services immediately.  If you reside outside of the United States and you change your mind for any or no reason, and if you have not accessed the Services, you are entitled to a full refund of all monies paid if you request such within the "cooling-off" period provided by law in the jurisdiction of your residency (as indicated by your credit card details). Please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@hellogbye.com">legal@hellogbye.com</a> to request such a refund.  The refund method will be determined by HelloGbye and will depend upon the payment method.</p>

              <p><strong>4.  TRANSACTION, CANCEL AND CHANGE FEES.</strong>  Should you choose to contact a Third Party Provider directly to perform a booking, cancellation or change to an itinerary, please note that the then in effect Third Party Provider administration fees will be charged by the Third Party Provider to your credit card.  HELLOGBYE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY ITINERARY OR PART OF ONE THAT IS BOOKED, CANCELLED, CHANGED OR MODIFIED OUTSIDE OF THE SITE AND/OR THE APP.</p>

              <p>PLEASE NOTE THAT IN ADDITION TO ANY APPLICABLE ACCESS FEE OR THIRD PARTY PROVIDER ADMINISTRATION FEE, AIRLINE PROVIDERS, HOTELS AND OTHER TRAVEL SERVICE PROVIDERS MAY CHARGE FEES UNDER THEIR CANCELLATION AND/OR CHANGE POLICIES. </p>

              <p>In the event that you do not show for the first night of a hotel reservation and plan to check-in for subsequent nights in your reservation, we recommend that you confirm the reservation changes with the hotel no later than the date of the first night of the reservation to prevent cancellation of your reservation and ensuing cancellation fees. </p>

              <p><strong>5. FREE TRIALS FOLLOWED BY AUTOMATIC CHARGING. <em>* From time to time, we may offer trials of Memberships for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate (</strong>Trial</em>*).  HelloGbye reserves the right, in its absolute discretion, to determine your eligibility for a Trial, and, subject to applicable laws, to withdraw or modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the greatest extent permitted under the law.</p>

              <p>Trials will require that you to provide your payment details to start the Trial.  AT THE END OF A TRIAL, WE MAY AUTOMATICALLY START TO CHARGE YOU FOR THE MEMBERSHIP ON THE FIRST DAY FOLLOWING THE END OF THE TRIAL, ON A RECURRING MONTHLY BASIS.  BY PROVIDING YOUR PAYMENT DETAILS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE TRIAL, YOU AGREE TO THIS CHARGE USING SUCH PAYMENT DETAILS.    </p>

              <p>IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE CHARGED ON A RECURRING MONTHLY BASIS, YOU MUST CANCEL THE MEMBERSHIP THROUGH YOUR ACCOUNT SETTINGS PAGE BEFORE THE END OF THE RECURRING MONTHLY PERIOD.  </p>

              <p>MEMBERSHIPS CANNOT BE TERMINATED BEFORE THE END OF THE PERIOD FOR WHICH YOU HAVE ALREADY PAID, AND EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THESE TERMS, HELLOGBYE WILL NOT REFUND ANY FEES THAT YOU HAVE ALREADY PAID. THE LIMITATION SECTION SETS FORTH ADDITIONAL TERMS REGARDING CANCELLATION OF YOUR MEMBERSHIP. PRIVILEGES SUCH AS CASH-BACK ARE SUBJECT TO FORFEITURE ON CANCELLATION OF YOUR MEMBERSHIP.</p>

              <p><strong>6. TRY FEATURE.</strong> HelloGbye may provide from time to time a "try" feature permitting visitors to perform a limited amount of travel management searches.  Anonymous visitors will not have the ability to purchase any travel-related or entertainment services, and the use of the Site or the App by such persons remains subject to these Terms.   </p>

              <p><strong>7. TRANSMISSION OF PERSONAL AND PROPRIETARY INFORMATION OVER BORDERS.</strong> Yo acknowledge and agree that by providing HelloGbye and Third Party Providers with any and all personal or proprietary personal information you consent to the transmission of the personal and proprietary information over international borders as necessary in accordance with HelloGbye and Third Party Provider standard business practices.</p>

              <p><strong>8. DESIGNATING ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL TO MAKE RESERVATIONS ON YOUR BEHALF.</strong> While you may designate another individual, or service approved by us, to manage your travel itinerary and purchase travel-related or entertainment services on your own behalf from Third Party Providers, you are responsible for all activities that occur with the use of your ID including without limitation any costs or charges incurred.</p>

              <p>HelloGbye and Third Party Providers may rely on the authority of anyone accessing the Site or the App using your ID without further investigation by HelloGbye or Third Party Providers and in no event will HelloGbye or Third Party Providers be held liable to you for any claims, expense, liabilities, loss or damage resulting from or arising out of (i) any action or inaction of HelloGbye under this provision; (ii) any unauthorized access to your account or Small Business Account; (iii) unauthorized use of your ID; or (iv) any compromise of the confidentiality of your ID or personal information.  </p>

              <p><strong>9. SECURITY BREACHES.</strong> You agree to notify HelloGbye immediately of any disclosure or unauthorized use of your ID or any other breach of security at <a href="mailto:security@hellogbye.com">security@hellogbye.com</a>.  It is entirely your responsibility to maintain the confidentiality of your ID.  HelloGbye reserves the right in its discretion to take any and all action as it deems necessary or reasonable to maintain the security of the Site, the App and your ID, including terminating your account or Small Business Account, locking you out of your account or Small Business Account, changing your password, or requesting information to authorize transactions on your account or Small Business Account.  While we take prudent steps to protect your ID, the Site and the App, we cannot be and are not responsible to protect your ID or your other information outside of the Site or the App. </p>

              <p>For more information regarding the information that we collect from you and how we use it, please consult our <a href="legal.html">Privacy Statement</a></p>

              <p><strong>10.

For foreign entry requirements, consult with the relevant governments, consulates or embassies prior to booking travel to international destinations. Requirements may change and you should check for up-to-date information before booking and departure.  HelloGbye accepts no liability if you are refused entry onto a flight, train or cruise or into any country for any reason, including due to your failure to carry the correct and adequate passport, visa, or other travel documents required by any airline, authority, or country, including countries you may just be transiting through.  This includes all stops made by the aircraft, train or ship, even if you do not leave the aircraft, airport, train station, ship or port, as the case may be. You may incur additional expenses if you are denied entry. </p>

              <p>Disinsection is permitted under international law in order to protect public health, agriculture and the environment. Some individuals may experience transient discomfort following aircraft disinsection by aerosol application.

              <p><em>*40.    CHOICE OF LAW. *</em> Unless otherwise required by a mandatory law, the Terms (and any non-contractual disputes/claims arising out of or in connection with them) are subject to the laws of the state or country listed below, without regard to choice of conflicts of law principles.  Further, you and HelloGbye agree to the jurisdiction of the courts listed below to resolve any dispute, claim or controversy that arises in connection with the Terms (and any non-contractual disputes/claims arising out of or in connection with them).  </p>

              <p><strong>Country</strong>:            </p>

              <p>Canada: laws of the Province of Ontario, jurisdiction exclusive to the Courts of Ontario, Canada</p>

              <p>United States: laws of the State of Delaware, jurisdiction exclusive to the State and Federal Courts of Delaware. </p>

              <p>WHERE PERMITTED UNDER THE APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND HELLOGBYE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. Unless both you and HelloGbye agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</p>

              <p><strong>41.    ARBITRATION</strong>: If you are located in, are based in, have offices in, or do business in a jurisdiction in which this discussion of arbitration is enforceable, the following mandatory arbitration provisions apply to you. You and HelloGbye agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and HelloGbye arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Terms or to your relationship with HelloGbye as a user of the Services (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Terms) will be determined by mandatory binding individual arbitration. THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.  There may be more limited discovery than in a court and the arbitrator may not award declaratory or injunctive relief benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration.  The arbitration provision will survive termination of the Terms. Notwithstanding the above, you and HelloGbye agree that nothing herein will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time to (i) bring an individual action in small claims court; (ii) pursue enforcement actions through applicable federal, state, provincial or local agencies here such actions are available; (iii) seek injunctive relieve in a court of law; or (iv) to file suite in a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims.</p>

              <p><strong>a.    ARBITRATION RULES</strong>: Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings.  Any arbitration between you and HelloGbye will be finally settled under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (<strong>ICC) <em>*then in force (</strong>ICC Rules)</em>* by one or more arbitrators appointed in accordance with the ICC Rules, as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the International Court of Arbitration of the ICC.  Any arbitration will be conducted in the English language and unless otherwise required by a mandatory law, the law to be applied in any arbitration shall be the law of the State of Delaware, United States, without regard to choice of conflict of law principles.</p>

              <p><strong>b.    ARBITRATION FILING:</strong> Any arbitration must be commenced by filing a demand for arbitration within one (1) year after the date the party asserting the claim first knows or reasonably should know of the act, omission, or default giving rise to the claim; and there shall be no right to any remedy for any claim not asserted within that time period.  If applicable law prohibits a one-year limitation period for asserting claims, any claim must be asserted within the shortest time period permitted by applicable law.</p>

              <p><strong>c.    ARBITRATION NOTICE, PROCESS:</strong> A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other by certified mail, or in the event that we do not have a current physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (<strong>Notice)</strong>.  HelloGbye’s administrative office for Notice is 25 York Street, Suite 612, Toronto, Ontario M5J 2V5 attention: Legal.  The notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought (<strong>Demand</strong>).  We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or HelloGbye may commence an arbitration proceeding.  During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or HelloGbye shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.  In the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favour, HelloGbye shall pay you (iii) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any; (iv) the last written settlement amount offered by HelloGbye in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s award; or (v) USD$1,000.00, whichever is greater.  All documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of arbitrator’s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.  Except as required to enforce the arbitrator’s decision and award, neither you nor HelloGbye shall make any public announcement or public comment or originate any publicity concerning the arbitration, including, but not limited to, the fact that the parties are in dispute, the existence of the arbitration, or any decision or award of the arbitrator.</p>

              <p><strong>d.    ARBITRATION MODIFICATIONS:</strong> In the event that HelloGbye makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than an address change for Notice purposes), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to HelloGbye’s address for Notice, in which case your account or Small Business Account with HelloGbye will immediately be terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the amendments you reject, shall survive.  </p>

              <p><strong>e.    ARBITRATION ENFORCEABILITY</strong>: If the class action waiver in the Terms is found to be unenforceable in arbitration or if any part of Section 41 are found to be invalid or unenforceable, the entirety of this Section 41 shall be null and void and, in such case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 40 shall govern any action arising out of or related to the Terms.</p>

              <p><em>*42.    INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. *</em> You acknowledge that a violation or attempted violation of any of these Terms will cause such damage to us as will be irreparable, the exact amount of which would be impossible or difficult to ascertain and for which there will be no adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, you agree that we are entitled as a matter of right to injunctive relief from any court of competent jurisdiction, restraining such violation or attempted violation of these Terms by you, or your affiliates, partners, or agents, without having to post a bond or other security.</p>
